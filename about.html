          <p>PixelFilter cuts through the noise with a sound born from distortion, discipline, and pure energy. A former metal guitarist turned audio engineer/programmer, his path into electronic sound was never straight — it was forged through years of crafting, breaking, and reshaping sonic textures.</p>
          <p>Two distinct forces drive his music. One side dives into the raw, hypnotic energy of underground Techno — shaped by late-night dancefloors, industrial textures, and stripped-back rhythms. The other taps into his cultural roots, channeling the vibrant spirit of South Asia through infectious, groove-driven Indo House. Separate sounds. Same pulse.</p>
          <p>Beyond the decks, PixelFilter helps curate Hyperbolic Chamber, a platform dedicated to championing raw, genre-bending sounds and rising underground artists.</p>
          <p>Every set is engineered for movement — hypnotic rhythms, deep cuts, and an atmosphere that pulls you in and doesn't let go.</p>
